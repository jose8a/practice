## `common_substrings`
Write a function, `common_substrings(str1, str2)` that takes two
strings and returns the longest common substring.

## `sum_rec`
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns their
sum. Use recursion.

## `fibs`
Write a function, `fibs(num)` which returns the first n elements from
the fibonnacci sequence, given n.

## `isPalindrome`
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string and returns true if
it's a palindrome, false if it's not. Use Javascript.

This solution takes less time and memory than rebuilding the string
backward and comparing the two.

## `valid_ip?`
Write a method that takes a string as input. It should return true if
the input is a valid IPv4 address (ie. anything between `0.0.0.0` and
`255.255.255.255` is valid).

## `sum_from_file`
Write a method that reads in a file of integers, one per line, and
sums them. Skip the line if it begins with a `"#"`.
