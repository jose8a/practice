# Exploring FizzBuzz
  This is an exercise in trying out different programming paradigms while solving the
  well known Fizzbuzz programming 'puzzle'. The pardigms will be utilized either in 
  isolation or in combination (where appropriate), while using Javascript.  Javascript 
  is one of many programming languages categorized as a multi-paradigm language ([source] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html)).  This 
  makes it possible to tackle programming tasks in the various paradigms supported by 
  the language.

  An outline of several programming paradigms can be found here:

## Fizzbuzz Problem Statement:
### The problem parameters are often outlined as follows:
  * As input: a list of numbers from 1 to MAX_NUM is applied to a solution
  * The solution generates as output: a list of strings with the following characteristics
    - for any number perfectly divisible by 3, results in "fizz"
    - for any number perfectly divisible by 5, results in "buzz"
    - for any number perfectly divisible by both 3 and 5, results in "fizzbuzz"
    - Each solution will generate an array filled with an empty string for any non-fizzbuzz number and the appropriate fizzbuz string for any numbers that match 3 and/or 5.
